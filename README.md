# About

A discord bot which searches for videos on youtube and plays the audio. It can pause, resume, skip, queue...<br>
In order for it to play music you need to be in a voice channel. When you play the song the bot will find you and automatically enter the voice channel. When the last song of the queue is over or when you use '/leave' the bot will leave the channel.
